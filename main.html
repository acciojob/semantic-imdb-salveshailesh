      Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief with the rare ability to enter
      people's dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious. His skill
      has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has
      also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when
      he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's
      mind. If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy
      anticipates Cobb's every move.
